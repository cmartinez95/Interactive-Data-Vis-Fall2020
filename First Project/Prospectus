For the exploratory project, I would like to take a look at unemployment statistics from https://labor.ny.gov/stats/lslaus.shtm. I would like to use a line-graph to show the trend of both the labor force as a whole and the unemployment rate from 1976 (the first month it was calculated)  until September of 2020 (the last month it was calculated). My idea for this graph is that there would be a slow transition from start to finish, so you could see how over time both the labor force and the unemployment rate are changing, and how they relate to each other over time.
