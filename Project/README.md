# Project 1 - Exploratory Visualization

## Prospectus

For the Exploratory Visualization project, I would like to explore NYC school datasets (from the [NYC Open Data](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/2013-2018-School-ELA-REsults/qkpp-pbi8)) which contain English Language Arts (ELA) results along with the general demographics of each school (total 1119 school). With two other variables (Chronic Absence Rate & Economic Needs Index), I am interested in searching for potential relationship between the ELA results of schools and these two independent variables. Also, I would like to present the distribution of ELA results based on the borough of schools by creating interactive plot and chart, so that the users can explore each school by seeing the location, ELA result, and absence rate. 


## Sketches

This data will be presented with the following forms of exploratory visualizations:

- scatter plot with a dropdown filter & tooltips
- Bar graph with tooltips

These are the sketches of how these visualiztions would look and interact.
